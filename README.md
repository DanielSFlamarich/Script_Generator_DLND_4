# Script Generator
Via a recurrent neural network, a fake Seinfeld TV script is generated. Data used is part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will work based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

## Further Explanation
The third project on neural networks in the udacity deep learning nanodegree, here recurrent neural networks are introduced.
